It is easy to create, essentially consisting of just string and gunpowder, but be warned: the chemicals concerned WILL stain clothing, and as always, due concern is advised.[br][br]Materials required:[br][br]-	String (preferably cotton)[br]-	Black gun powder[br]-	Baxtrin[br][br]The string should be coated with a thin layer of baxtrin, which acts as an adhesive. The string is then carefully rolled in the gun powder, and left to dry at least a couple of minutes before use.[br][br][new_page][br]Chapter 2.1 Dynamite[br][br]Invented by Alfred Nobel in 1866, dynamite is commonly used in construction, mining, and demolition. It has proved far safer to handle than alternatives such as pure nitro-glycerine, provided, that is, it has been properly stored.  Over time, the explosive component of dynamite, supposedly made safe by the presence of the diatomaceous earth, has a tendency to weep, making an old box of the explosive liable to detonate on contact.[br][br]Materials required:[br][br]- 1 part diatomaceous earth[br]- 3 parts nitroglycerine[br]- small amount of sodium carbonate[br][br][Text unreadable] and then simply form into short sticks and wrap in paper.[br][new_page][br]Chapter 2.3 Trinitrotoluene (TNT)[br][br]TNT was first discovered, in 1863, by German chemist Joseph Wilbrand, but it took some years before it yielded its true potential. This was because of the difficulty of making it explode and the lesser detonation in comparison to dynamite. The main advantage was discovered by the German navy, who employed TNTs relative explosive stability in order to cause massive damage to British warships.  Their torpedoes could be detonated inside a ships armour, rather than exploding on contact as did other shells.[br][new_page][br]Chapter 2.6 Armstrong's mixture[br][br]Armstrong's mixture is included in this book as more of a point of interest, than as a viable chemical mix.  The formula exists as somewhat of a legend in modern pyrotechnics, referenced, by those knowledgeable enough to stay away from it, as Death Mix.

    <Entry Name="strangearticle">Copenhagen Post, Monday 17th August 1930[br]Psychotropic Deposits at the Bottom of "Death-Mine"?[br][br]Researchers at the University of Copenhagen have suggested that mind altering chemicals, naturally sewn into the rock, may be the cause of high suicide rates at a Greenland mine.[br][br]The university, which has recently been conducting studies into isolated communities, first became interested in the workers of the North-Western Lead Mine last year.  They discovered that even taking into account Greenland's naturally higher suicide rate, local figures for the last 100 years were abnormally high, at 46 deaths per 100 000 populace, compared to the national average of 29.[br][br]On further investigation, experts diagnosed, in many of the miners, symptoms in common with the earlier stages of paranoid schizophrenia.  This has prompted researchers to hypothesise that natural deposits of lysergic acid, a pH 4 formula recently discovered to have hallucinogenic properties, may be present in the rocks.[br][br]Few locals were conducive to interview, but those who agreed to speak had their own explanation: Inuit spirits known as the "Tuurngait" live in the mountains.[br][br]The university is awaiting the results of chemical testing.  Studies continue.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="spiderhater">Day 200[br][br]It has been sometime since I recorded any findings in relation to the spiders with whom I have shared my existence for the past eight months, partly due to my enforced retreat from their basement territory. Not too long ago, their behaviour became overtly aggressive, and so I have attempted to barricade the main entrance to their lair, and secured myself within one of the smaller rooms above it, the only one with an operational door lock. [br][br]The other reason is that I have been recovering from a minor operation, which I was forced to conduct myself, without the aid of anaesthetic. Even if I did have any anaesthetic or surgical tools, I couldn't afford to be less than diligent in my work, so anaesthetic was out. Surgical tools are all well and good, but, although it may be becoming old and rusty, I still trust my pen knife to do the job just as well. [br][br]The procedure itself was elementary enough, a simple amputation of a non-vital organ. I began to notice a thick, glue like substance forming on my tongue, and was forced to accept that it had become infected through constant toxin ingestion.[br][new_page][br]Day 300[br][br]Another century of days comes and goes: it seems like so long since I escaped here. At some stage since my last entry, I attempted to return from whence I came: that from which I originally was fleeing seems a fate far worse than the one I now face. However, in the time since I arrived from the larger mine system, a cave-in has occurred, blocking any further progress. I was forced to return and accept whatever end life has in store for me.[br][br]I still hear my aggressive little friends scratching on the door to my cell.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="greenland">Inuit Mythology:[br]Christian Foresight[br]first published 1903[br][br]Over the past hundred years, our people has seen something of a religious revelation.  The Kalaallit, and Inuit in general, might be said to have seen the error of our ways, and Christianity has become increasingly embraced throughout the arctic communities. It is the purpose of this paper to explore the true roots of our long held beliefs, and to uncover how they might be justified today, in our new found enlightenment. As such, this essay will be the first I have written in English, as opposed to our native kalaaleq.[br][new_page][br]Anirniit[br][br]It is no coincidence that the word [u8216]anirnaq[u8217] bears resemblance to the English word [u8216]angel[u8217]. The anirniit are the Inuit equivalent of the soul, an undying entity, released in the death of its worldly body. The concept itself is obviously well grounded in decent Christian belief, however, previous thought has been blasphemous to the extent that souls are attributed to all beings, man or beast. To claim such a thing would be to imply that the killing of a beast for food is the same as the murder of your fellow man, and such a belief simply cannot be held the civilised Inuit.[br][new_page][br]Tuurngait[br][br]Legends speak of disembodied spirits, malicious in nature, sabotaging tools, turning hunts bad, and at times even possessing the weak or unfortunate. A tuurngaq appears to have no recognised or agreed origin, both in terms of the legend itself, and the individual being, causing great doubt to be entirely justifiable. Can we, in our Christian foresight, really believe in possessions and evil spirits? It seems perfectly clear to this writer that the real origin of the tuurngait belief lies in the Christian demon. For, as we are taught by the generous and selfless Moravian church - without whose support, our people would no doubt have starved many years ago [u8211] the demon is capable of possession and of countless other atrocities, which only the good Christian man can avoid through a lifetime of humility and devotion.[br][new_page][br]Angakuit[br][br]With the conclusions reached above, the status of the cherished angakuk, the tribe shaman, should be obvious. Such people are in league with the tuurngait demons, working side by side to control and contain the Kalaallit people. We have no need for such superstition and suspicion breeding people in our Christian ways: the protestant priest can perform all of the angakuit[u8217]s duties, and more beside.[br][new_page][br]God[br][br]The final challenge of a work such as this should be to find the nature of the Christian God, and to ask why he has not been present for so many years of Inuit belief. Until recently, the Inuit people wrongly attributed to anirniit almost god-like status in certain cases, and treated the tuurngait as the devil incarnate. It is no major leap of faith to suggest that such beliefs have been underpinned by a central concern that there has been something missing in Inuit life. That something is, indubitably, God.[br][new_page][br]I hope that my findings have informed and enlightened the atheistic few that remain in Inuit culture, and ask the lord Jesus Christ to redeem their souls.[br][br]Peter-Henry Natur</Entry>

God knows, you need something to keep you entertained down here. However, you all know full well that Penrose has some very deep seated issues with his height, so anyone who thought it'd be a good idea to sabotage his generator, then hide all the spare fuses on the top shelf in the store room would quite clearly need his head examined, you get me?[br][br]In other news, Jones, I want that inventory done yesterday. And the rest of you, it[u8217]s not all fun and games, you hear? On a serious note, another radio's gone missing. And you'd better hope to god that means one of you's lost it, because stealing ain't a pretty word in my book.  It's the third one this month, which means the amnesty on coming clean is fast coming to a close.  Then there'll be repercussions, got it?[br][br]What's strange is, you're all supposed to be working in pairs, so nobody should be able to get their hands on a radio without the other spotting it. When I find out who's responsible, I'm gonna find out how they got away with it so long, then I'm gonna fling them out into the snow and leave 'em there.

    <Entry Name="waterfindings">The test substance continues to defy identification: both chemical and xeno investigations fail to produce meaningful results.

So far, removing it from its dormant location causes its base state to radically change, producing massive heat (to the detriment of three workers, one of whom is no longer operational due to his injuries). Following heat dissipation, the substance appears to turn dead, unreactive to every test we have the equipment to run. The prevailing theory is that somehow, the disruption of the material causes it to enter hugely accelerated chemical decay. We estimate its half life to be approximately 0.4 seconds.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="xenoreport">Xeno Report 66b[br]Phase 9, Anno 9002 (Anno Domini 1992)[br]filed by Chief Attending Xeno Officer[br]for the eyes of the Leading Installation Officer ONLY[br][br]Leader,[br][br]Unlike the other findings, 66b appears to be of manufactured, rather than natural, origin, and so warrants additional interest - and, need I say, security.[br][br]The bulk of substance 63 was discovered only six yards from where artefact 66b was buried, and appears, at least in part, to consist of a solidified form of 63, with a number of operable appendages. The artifact emits a low level of light from a seemingly inexhaustible energy supply, suggesting its origin is indeed as was suspected. Of course, the ramifications of this fact are clear, and appropriate measures are already being taken. [br][br]Progress in becoming enlightened as to the purpose of the device, if, indeed, it served a purpose in the traditional sense at all, has been slow. Following protocol to the letter, I assigned my Secondary Officer to the artefact on phase 7, only for him to go missing the following day. He eventually returned to the site from a previously uncharted area of the mines, presumably having discovered a new route, avoiding the cave-ins. At this stage we can only assume what transpired, since he remains in a state of disorientation.[br][br]Far be it from me to question the decisions of the Elevated Caste, but I am struggling to understand the necessity of conducting standard scientific testing in this case. I, of course, have full faith in the abilities of the research team, put together and sent here by my immediate superior, I simply wonder whether their time might be better employed on the main site.[br][br]Nevertheless, it is comforting to know that the actions of every member of the organisation are carefully choreographed and controlled by those far outranking myself, both in stature and wisdom, and with this in mind, I feel fully justified in filing an official request for further manpower. We have already lost a number of workers to unforeseen events - largely while engaging in the studies mentioned earlier - and further investigation of the area calls for volunteers to carry out tasks altogether too hazardous in nature to risk the wellbeing of more elevated organisation members. In particular, the tunnel system above the secondary site requires immediate cartography.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="waterlog">Log: Secondary Excavation Site B[br]Beginning [u8211] Phase 338, Anno 9000 (Anno Domini 1990)[br]filed by Chief Attending Chemist[br]security status nil[br][br]Anno 9000[br][br]Phase 338[br]Today marks the first phase of Excavation Team B[u8217]s new assignment, which I will be overseeing. Equipment has arrived, and digging should be able to commence within the next few hours. Since the incident leading to the establishment of our facility here, much work has been undertaken in order to ascertain the scope of the discovery. This site, among others, was selected from many possible candidates thanks to powerful divination techniques passed down for many generations amongst the Elevated Caste, and I feel certain that this wisdom, in combination with our own seismic techniques, will prove to be a great success, and that our discoveries will be of great importance to the organisation. Best of luck everyone.[br][br]Anno 9001[br][br]Phase 1[br]While work has been slow up until now, the new year is sure to bring with it great prosperity for our team. Perhaps we shall enjoy some of the luck that the other teams seem to already be harvesting. Further routine work reports will be filed in a secondary log.[br][br]Phase 275[br]While the routine logbook has been filled many times over during the past nine moons, there has been so little of interest to report that I find my previously enthusiastic entries to appear as if written by someone else entirely. These logs are not for personal thoughts, but since no one is ever likely to read them, I am probably safe in saying that I sometimes catch myself wishing I had never received this assignment at all, and was still stationed at the main facility. We discovered a tunnel system today, running through the roof of the cave, which caused a minor rock slide, but no serious injuries were sustained. More's the pity, perhaps if this place became a hazard we could all be reassigned. The noises in this mine at night are beginning to play with my mind. That is, when you can tell what time of day it is.[br][br]Phase 341[br]Although I have now been in charge of Site B for two cycles, this marks my first entry into the excavation log as the new Chief Attending Chemist. Looking through the scarce results filed for the initial year[u8217]s work, I can see why my predecessor was replaced. In a fraction of that time, I have achieved Team B[u8217]s first major breakthrough in the discovery of previously unknown Substance 63, and the research team has been assigned tasks in record time. I fully expect complete identification of the substance to be available within seven phases. Furthermore, I have conducted an investigation into the noises reported by workers in this area of the mine, in the interest of morale. On nights that I spend here, there do indeed appear to be strange, human like cries coming from somewhere deep in the rocks, but there is bound to be some explanation.[br][br]Anno 9002[br][br]Phase 6[br]Following the discovery of Sub 63, my team has had a second triumph in the unearthing of Artefact 66b. My team and I will, of course, deal with this finding with our usual level of efficiency.[br][br]Phase 7[br]The caste has seen fit to bring in a Xeno Team, in order to further extract the true nature of the artefact. I applaud their foresight in this decision, and would only note that if been given the chance, my chemistry team would have performed at least as well in this task. In additional notes, I have completed my analysis of the wailing and chattering sounds reported by those spending large amounts of time in this locale, and conclude that it is a symptom of dehydration. Lack of water has caused very mild hallucination which, combined with quite natural seismic activity, can sound a little like human voices. A thorough medical examination of the afflicted workers has been recommended, but in the interests of continuing work at maximum capacity, I have instead ordered increased water supplies, and implemented an obligatory three minute water break once every five hours.[br][br]Phase 9[br]It came to my attention today that the job of mapping the overhead tunnel system in this cave is long overdue, something overlooked from way back during the first stages of the excavation, sadly before my arrival, for otherwise it would already have been completed. The officer in charge of the Xeno team is increasingly becoming an obstacle to my own team[u8217]s research. He insists on overseeing perfectly routine tasks, when, given the defection of his second in command yesterday, I would suggest his time is better spent taking control of his own responsibilities. At heart, however, I believe him to be a thoroughly devoted follower, which is why I am certain that he would leap at the chance to volunteer for the surveying of the tunnel system. I have tried warning him of the potential hazards, but he simply will not take no for an answer, and asks that I ensure those higher up understand his enthusiasm.[br][br]Phase 18[br]In a most disheartening turn, the Chief Xeno Officer has not returned from his brave exploration of the tunnel system.[br][br]Phase 24[br]In the days since the Chief Xeno Officer[u8217]s foolhardy trespassing into the tunnel system, which now appears to make up the domain for various aggressive local fauna, said creatures have become increasingly hostile, venturing into the excavation site on more than one occasion. This is something which I will be keeping a close eye on.[br][br]Phase 50[br]This will be the final entry into the log for Excavation Site B - events have forced us to curtail our work. We have taken more than one casualty to the organisms living above this cave system, leaving us no choice but to carry what equipment and documentation we can, abandoning all else. Their attacks have developed a discernable pattern, and we are due another in only a few minutes, so I must hurry. It[u8217]s ironic, the noises that have been reported since the initiation of this project are still present. Except that now, they sound more like laughing.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="explorersdiary">Last Will &amp; Testament of Joe Freeman[br]Final Thoughts[br]10/10/00[br][br]I, Joe Freeman, would like to leave all my personal belongings to my sister, May, in the knowledge that she will distribute them wisely.[br][br]We always used to say, better to die young, than to never live at all. I guess we're going to get our wish. I know enough about survival to realise I won't be surviving much longer. John-O, my buddy - I just don't know. My left leg is broken in three places, and I suspect I may also have shattered my pelvic bone.[br][br]Three hours ago, after we'd set up camp, John-O set off to find some usable timber for the fire. When he got back, he was very excited. I couldn't work out what it was that had got him so agitated, but I went along with it all the same. I should have recognised the signs: soon after, he got worse. He jumped me when I turned away, burying my face in the snow, trying to suffocate me. I still don't know what he found in the ice to enrage him so. 'Lucky' for me, the ground gave way, and we both fell.[br][br]I landed hard on ice, and desperately clawed my way onto more solid ground. I was running on adrenaline, didn't notice the pain, I just knew that if I was going to die, I didn't want it to be in the frozen water beneath me. When you fall into a frozen lake, you don't just drown, or freeze to death. Your whole body seizes up from the cold. Every instinct tells you to swim for the side, but your body won't let you. You gradually dip under the surface, your last breath expelled when you fell. But you don't drown there and then: your body shuts everything down, survives on what strength you have left. You can last for an hour, just floating there, slowly, slowly, dying.[br][br]So now, I'm lying here, my soaked gortex slowly freezing me in place, me on one side of the lake, John-O trapped on the other. I'm worried about him. From what I can see from this side, his arm is dislocated, his shoulder blade fractured, and his wrist broken. I can't hear anything he yells, but he looks to be constantly muttering to himself... testing the ice with a crowbar from his pack. I don't know how he can stand the pain, or where his strength is coming from, but at any rate, something strange happened to him. Fortunately for me, he can't cross the ice: it'll give way under his weight. The only way to cross would be to carefully spread your weight evenly across the surface, and he looks in too much of a rush for that.[br][br]There's a lot of drugs in my system right now. I have another bottle of painkillers, there's enough to finish the job. I always said I'd rather die pushing the boundaries, than drift away in my sleep.[br][br]I guess I didn't mean that after all. I'd rather gently slip away, than die cold, or bleeding.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="fishermanswife">Dearest Eric, [br][br]Just a quick note before you set sail and leave me once again. [br][br]I've left you a little something to remember me by in the chest at the foot of your bed. I really don't know why you still only have one bed on board, taking shifts because of it is no way to get your rest. But what does a fisherman's wife know of life at sea?[br][br]I'll be praying every night for you to make the catch you need, so that you can come home to me safely, and soon. Please don't be gone for five weeks like last time! I know I might nag sometimes, but I do love you, you know.[br][br]I've washed those overalls of yours, I know you'll get them covered in assorted fish parts in no time, but I still feel better knowing they've had a wash.[br][br]Before I forget, the Henriksons in the village have asked me to see if you'll be coming by any trout, but I said they were mostly out of season. If you do happen upon any, don't say anything. Stow them well in the ice, and I'll do something special with them to celebrate when you come home to me. The ship's captain deserves a little special treatment once in a while![br][br]Take care my love.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="officerslog">15th August 1945[br]Command Bunker: Emergency Airstrip Zulu[br]Weekly Report[br][br]Another unremarkable week in Greenland:[br]- regular supply shipment received[br]- standard emergency drills carried out[br]- routine runway maintenance completed[br]  (I have ordered maintenance be carried out twice weekly from here on in, due to increased snow fall)[br]- one wounded[br][br]The one wounded figure is no cause for concern back in London: the Germans haven't extended their frontline by 4000 miles. Two of my men were caught manufacturing cherry bombs in our workshop/armoury, and succeeded in blowing off a couple of fingers. I take partial responsibility for this, in that I allowed them access to the demolitions manual we keep in the store room, and I'm sure that's where they learnt the ingredients. As a precautionary measure, I have now locked up that manual in the chest in my office, and will keep the key on my person at all times. Needless to say, both men have been disciplined, and the injured man has been sent home for medical care. I cannot help but think that a more suitable punishment would have been for him to stay out here, but the matter is out of my hands. [br][br]This base is so disconnected, sometimes, I feel as if this war could end, and we might not even hear about it out here.[br][br]Supplies Requisition Order:[br]- dynamite for excavation purposes[br]- 7 bayonets (not necessary in my opinion, but procedure states we should have a full complement)[br]- 1 industrial ice pick (for removing the damn ice that forms on the external hatch)[br]- 1 pair of reading glasses, category 7-C (an order for myself, my glasses are in rather a poor state of repair and could do with replacing)[br][br]Reconditioning of the mine continues to progress. The structure is being fortified from potential bomb damage, and excavation of previously caved in areas is going ahead.[br][br]One point of curiosity is some kind of archaeological find, an artefact buried in the earth, and discovered by one of the work teams. Later this evening, after marshal duty, I shall take a closer look at the artefact. It appears to be man made, and may have working parts inside. I shall remove what looks like the front cover, and see if I can't discover the source of the light which constantly emanates from it.[br][br]Chief NCO M. Major</Entry>

Petyrs, MSc, PhD[br]Completed between the dates of 30th March, 1969 and 1st January, 1972[br]At the North-Western Research Station, within the North-Western Iron Mine[br]With the permission of Delta Mining Corp[br][br]Replication of Selected Extracts, left at the disposal of mine foreman[br][br]Subject of Study: genus Rhyacophila[br](Commonly: Grey Rock Worm)[br]Aim: to investigate the abnormal presence of the caddis in the Greenland rock[br]Method: collection of samples (if, indeed, they can be identified correctly), standard series of testing, observation and dissection.[br][br]Personal Notes:[br]Upon arrival at the mining facility, I was immediately stunned by the sheer volume of fauna that finds a way of life down here, despite the conditions. In general, one would assume that species whose natural habitat is past a certain depth, would find the intrusion of human activity too great a threat to remain in place, however, almost the exact opposite seems to be the case in this instance. It is curious that certain areas of the mine appear to be entirely without life of any kind, and yet other, deeper areas are teeming, and, were the situation permitting, I would embrace the opportunity to commit further time to the study of these organisms.  However, the purpose of my stay here shall continue to be the genus Rhyacophila.[br][new_page][br]&lt;ME&gt;[br][br]Ah, finally, some writing paper! Look at me, just using up the pages to scrawl down whatever comes into my head! Hah! What is this stuff anyway... some kind of research paper... no matter, it's paper all the same: I can finally record what's been happening down here for... I suppose about a year now... it must be near the end of 2001 by now. Huh, I wonder when Christmas was. No matter. Too tired to write now, will rest a little first.[br][new_page][br]&lt;PROFESSOR&gt;[br][br]Samples Collected:[br]The collection process has been far easier than I anticipated. The set up of the artificial environment for the rock worm went without a hitch, and the specimens themselves are so abundant as to make keeping them out far more challenging than containing them![br][br]They are all of healthy size, perhaps even beyond recorded size, and I can only assume that this is due to some lack of natural predators down here.[br][br]Specimens are as follows:[br]- 3 adults in artificial habitat[br]- 2 larval infants, dead[br][new_page][br]&lt;ME&gt;[br][br]I've been down here two days now, was meaning to record events every day, but was too busy securing the area. I've used some supplies from the old mining system to wall myself in here, it seems as safe a place as any, so those things should at least stay put for a little while.[br][br]To that end, seems I've had a pretty lucky stumbling here. All this old research is about something similar to what's been hunting me ever since I escaped the shelter four days ago. Don't get me wrong, after what... after what they did to me back there, I'd rather be facing anything else, and after almost a year of fighting for our lives, we didn't really stand a chance anyway. I don't know how many are left inside.[br][br]But this is good. These notes might have some way to fight the things... the rock worms that followed me here. I don't know how they knew I was coming, or how they managed to follow me in the dark, but maybe I can work that out now. I've found some old newspaper clippings, I guess they're referring to this mine. I had no idea it was so old... so big. I can see now why they built that facility here in the first place: a lot of history buried down here.[br][br]It worries me, though. We'd been resting all our hopes of rescue on one of the scientists who escaped right near the start of it all. He got out almost as the chaos began, so we figured he might have made it out, and brought help. But maybe me and him are due the same fate.[br][br]I must record what's been going on, give the world the answers it needs so it doesn't fall prey to what's been released down here. But first I need to worry about myself, find a way out of here, and work out how to kill these worm things.[br][new_page][br]&lt;PROFESSOR&gt;[br][br]Observations:[br][br]The creatures are indeed larger than has previously been recorded: the juveniles seem to still be growing, far beyond their natural limits, although the adults have now expired. I will watch with interest to see what the life span is of this particular subspecies.[br][br]The worms appear to have three senses, as would be validated by previous research: taste, smell, and an extremely sensitive sense of touch, which allows them to detect vibrations in the rock in the same way that the human eye senses beams of light and processes them into spatial images.[br][br]Their natural prey is insects smaller than themselves, and heaven help those insects, because the worm is a vicious and efficient killer.[br][new_page][br]&lt;ME&gt;[br][br]He's wrong. They have no sense of smell. Today, I attempted to distract them with a concoction I found lying around, but to no avail. However, it does seem that they detect movement via vibrations, which would explain how they can 'see' in the dark. Damn - there's amost no way to escape them down here. I'm on their territory now.[br][br]Lifespan is three days and counting. I can still hear them, outside the wall. As an extra precaution, I've locked myself in the smaller study area, connected to the main lab room. If they get through that wall, I doubt this door will stop them, but it's better than nothing. Barely.[br][new_page][br]&lt;PROFESSOR&gt;[br][br]Conclusions:[br]- this sub-species of genus Rhyacophila is highly adapted for its environment[br]- if released above the surface, it seems likely that it would quickly destroy the existing rock worm population, and soon after that, the population would grow to a size far outstripping its own food supplies[br]- given its increase in size and lifespan already, due to unknown conditions, I would hypothesise that the worm, if left in such conditions for a reasonable period of time (perhaps three to four thousand years) could grow up to a further three inches, making it a total of almost one foot long[br]- however, should those conditions change, or, indeed, magnify, physical evolution could occur far more rapidly[br][new_page][br]&lt;ME&gt;[br][br]It's the fifth day today, and I swear they have begun to surround my location. I can't tell whether or not they have breached the wall I built, but I'm certain they've entered whatever area surrounds this room. The future looks increasingly bleak.[br][br]I intended to record here the events of the past year, in the hope that perhaps what occurred could be contained, or driven away. Now, I realise I could write all I wanted, no one will ever make it down here to read it.[br][br]So why write this now? Good question. I have no answer. All I do know is, I'd rather take my own life, than die at the jaws of those hideous monsters. I have tied a noose. Those monsters may feed on my corpse, but they won't take my life.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="minersnote">24th February 1972[br][br]I write this note in the knowledge that it may well serve as my last will and testament. Myself and three other miners have been trapped beneath the main shaft to the surface for what we believe to be three days, but with no daylight, and increasing dehydration, it's impossible to tell. The only thing keeping us alive is the hope that there could be a rescue team already on the way. We were all so positive at the start, but that seems long ago now.  [br][br]Renton was the first to crack, some time during the first night. We all just lay there, trying to sleep through the sound of his wailing and sobbing, trying to pretend his problems weren't our own, and that he was weak for having given up so soon. The fact was, he was dealing with the situation pretty realistically: our chance of survival gets smaller every hour. Since then, he hasn't said much, but the despair that gripped him seems to have spread through the rest of us like a cancer.[br][br]We were such fools to ignore the foreman, and he paid for that with his life. When he started putting security code locks on all the doors, we thought he was crazy: there's only us down here after all, so why should we need codes to access places we're all allowed to go? He gave us all code sheets, made us swear to keep them safe - huh, mine hasn't left my locker more than once, it's still there, doesn't get much safer than that. We asked him who we were keeping them safe from, but he never said. It was a pain in the arse, is what it was. I had to trek all the way to that crazy biologist's office in the mining room this morning, just to check the code for Section C.[br][br]But he obviously knew something about these mines we didn't. Some of the guys started acting weird. Not crazy weird, just... not normal. That didn't stop a couple of them being carted off to mainland Europe for psychiatric help. It was no one I knew well. Until the incident three days ago.[br][br]We were in chemical storage, when one of the guys who had seemed pretty straight just started shouting. It wasn't a normal kind of shouting. I'm not any kind of word smith, so I just don't know how to describe the noises he was making. We'll just have to stick with not normal. Anyway, he managed to hurt a couple of guys, damage some equipment before we got him under control. Nothing serious. When we released him, he seemed OK. Phased, but alright. Didn't really know where he was, far away look in his eyes. That look... I'll remember that for the rest of my days, even if there aren't many more of them. His pupils weren't dilated... they just seemed to take up more space than should be possible: black, and horrible. Then he snapped, and grabbed up one of the high rated explosive packs. We knew what he intended, saw it in those eyes. Those that could, made a run for it, but the guy was already bearing down on the foreman, he didn't have a chance. There were five of us who made it out to the exit shaft. Only four survived the explosion. The elevator shaft collapsed in on us, and now, it's anyone's guess how many are still trapped down here.[br][br]The last thing I saw was those eyes. Seemed like they were staring at me, and me alone.[br][br]Miles Statton[br]</Entry>
    <Entry Name="newsclip1">Copenhagen Post, Friday 25th December 1970[br]Superstition Extinct, Death-Mine Still Breathing?[br][br]A worker at the North-Western Iron Mine, Greenland, is missing, presumed dead, as of midnight last night. Locals fear foul play.[br][br]Mining now forms the largest single industry in Greenland. At 16 years old, the North-Western Iron Mine is a relatively new part of a larger complex, which also includes a lead operation, and is built on the site of an older mine, later converted into a military bunker, and finally closed in 1952.[br][br]The iron mine retains its excellent work record, in spite of the recent disappearance of an as yet unnamed worker. We have discovered that the man in question was a young labourer brought in from mainland Europe, possibly Denmark, and authorities on both sides of the Strait are currently attempting to contact any family he may have left behind.[br][br]The man disappeared ten days ago, and the mine foreman has now exercised his power to declare him 'presumed dead'. This decision, we are told, was not taken lightly: a full search of the mining operation was commissioned to no avail; without the appropriate equipment or transport, the man could not have survived on the surface.[br][br]Although superstition in Greenland has seen a decrease in popularity over the past years, some local inhabitants still claim that the land itself is cursed. This very paper ran a report, almost 40 years ago to the day, discussing high suicide figures for the area, but findings at the time were considered to be inconclusive.[br][br]Lars Jensen</Entry>
    <Entry Name="newsclip2">KNR, Thursday 1st January 1974[br]Increased Sea Traffic Causes Local Concern[br][br]Inhabitants of a small village in the relatively desolate North-West have been reporting witnessing uncharacteristically large volumes of seaborne traffic over the past six months.[br][br]North West Greenland is virtually uninhabited by modern standards, containing just 0.1 persons per square kilometre, one third of the national average. Sea trade has dropped off dramatically since the closure of the North-Western lead and iron mines in March, 1972. The mine itself ceased operation due to massive structural failure, following an apparently accidental detonation of standard mining explosives, where all 47 workers were assumed killed in the blast. Bodies were not recovered.[br][br]Now, locals are complaining of noise pollution caused by a high and steady volume of ships sailing close to shore. Unfortunately, in order for any form of official enquiry to be undertaken, the registration codes of the ships in question must be recorded, and, since villagers claim the ships only travel under cover of darkness, this may mark a difficulty for their ongoing quest for justice.[br][br]Eric Nuunaat[br]</Entry>
    <Entry Name="newsclip3">KNR, Monday 7th June 1993[br]Minor Land Collapse in North-Western Mountain Range[br][br]Seismologists, on placement from the mainland, reported yesterday that a small area of tundra, about 100 square metres, collapsed into a cavity beneath the surface of the snow. The land was uninhabited.[br][br]The area in question is part of the North-Western Mountain Range, and the collapse was only noticed due to its coinciding with the arrival of an annual seismic survey team.[br][br]Experts have suggested natural cavities in the earth's crust as the cause of the collapse, although due to its vicinity to an old system of mines from the 1970s, they have not ruled out the possiblity of some kind of delayed explosion or other seismic activity. The probability that the mine is to blame for the event, however, is low, since it is very unlikely that activity on the scale observed could occur without some kind of human interference below the surface.[br][br]Ann Dixon</Entry>
    <Entry Name="redsnote">My Dearest Friend,[br][br]How are you? I am as well as can be expected. I have some sad news, though. A few days ago, there was some kind of collapse, and some of the ceiling of the cave fell in on me.  What scares me is that I was in an off limits part of the mine. They may not look for me here, but if they do, and they find me, I'll be in so much trouble![br][br]But I don't think I'll have to worry about that, because I'm not sure I'll be getting out of here.[br][br]I don't mind so much. I've been working in the mine for about three weeks now, and I'm really proud that I can send money home, but it's pretty tough work, and so far, you're the only person that's really been nice to me. Plus, I have some nice company down here. There's some friendly kinda creepy crawlies, and some books I brought from home that I was taking to the rec room. If you think about it, I was really quite lucky I had all this stuff with me, otherwise I'd be bored stiff! As it is, I have Shakespeare, Bronte, Nietzsche; perfect bedtime reading. Although, I suppose I might be trapped here long enough that I have to read them twice.[br][br]I always used to ask my mum how long people survive without food, and things. I read how some people can survive underwater for over five minutes, and some people last in the desert for weeks... but she always said you had three minutes of air, three days of water etc...  I suppose I'll probably find out soon enough.[br][br]I guess if I had to, I could find food around the place... like I said, there's all sorts of creatures here, but they're better off as my friends than my lunch. I wonder whether I shall starve to death, or go cave crazy first? Neither sounds too much fun, I guess, but if I had to choose, I'd say I'd want to go mad.[br][br]It sounds like an adventure.[br][br]Tom Redwood[br]Proper Mine Worker[br]December, 1970[br]Age 14</Entry>

    <Entry Name="spiderhater2">Day 1[br][br]I begin this record, still in the hope that the great work we have undertaken here might one day be of scientific value, despite the chaos which has ensued in the six hours previous.  My aim is to remain secure, until what help there may be arrives, and to that end I have barricaded myself into a small workshop area in the abandoned part of the mine. I hope that the meagre food rations here will keep me alive, and that those I hide from will not jeopardise that. Perhaps this mine really is cursed: it's almost precisely thirty years since the incident that brought us here, and now, thirty years on, fate has struck again.[br][new_page][br]Day 3[br][br]I forecasted that today the rescue crews would arrive, but I can only hypothesise that they would be unaware of my location, and hence busy themselves evacuating the other survivors.  If they have not arrived by tomorrow, I will go out in search of them.[br][new_page][br]Day 6[br][br]My first mistake was to make assumptions on the matter of rescue.  My second mistake was to make assumptions on the safety of this mine.  My third mistake was to act on both those assumptions in going outside of my safe haven.  [br][br]My best estimate is that I left the workshop where I was secured about two days ago in search of aid, and I have found only danger.  I approached the old living quarters, but curiously, could find no sign of life whatsoever.  I returned in what I thought was the direction from which I had come, but soon found myself in an unfamiliar locale.  Confused, but focused, I attempted to make my way home, but found myself threatened by some species of feral creature, which seems to have made this old mine its home.  [br][br]Although the specimen bore significant interest to me, I chose to retreat, only to find myself outmanoeuvred and outnumbered by the beasts.  I turned and ran, injuring my ankle in the process, which I believe now is most likely a sprain, rather than a fracture.  For some time I cowered and fled into the dark, but a few hours ago I discovered a door leading to a smaller, disused part of the mine, the key for which I still have in my pocket. Within that area I discovered this store room, and I think it should keep me safe for some time.  This place is a maze.[br][br]My lesson learnt: I will not venture out again until I am certain the area is safe.[br][new_page][br]Day 19[br][br]Rescue seems increasingly unrealistic.  Supplies diminishing.  Lots of spiders in this place.  I do not like spiders.[br][new_page][br]Day 34[br][br]I caught one of the accursed, eight legged beasts nestling in my open mouth when I woke up this morning.  In my surprise I swallowed it.  It's not so much the act of swallowing which concerns me, but the genus of arachnid.  It would be unlikely that a cave dwelling spider would be venomous to any significant degree, but the possibility troubles me all the same.[br][new_page][br]Day 35[br][br]Any known venom would have affected me by now, and so today is the first minor cause for celebration I have had since the incident.  By lucky coincidence, this revelation also means I have discovered a virtually inexhaustible supply of nutrition.  I intend to venture into the basement beneath this storeroom, in the name of science, to discover more about these creature's natural habitat.[br][new_page][br]Day 50[br][br]For four days now, I have been surviving solely off the quite considerable sustenance provided by the spiders.  For some time I was struggling to gather enough of the crunchy little morsels, however, lady luck smiled on me once more when the batteries in my torch died and I made a second life saving finding: the creatures' natural habitat is the dark.  With my light now diminished, I need only lie still for a few minutes, and I will have attracted enough of the beasts for a rather hearty meal.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="spiderhater3">Day 71[br][br]My earlier assumptions on the benign nature of my cell mates may have been made in error.  After a careful autopsy, I am concerned that there may be a small volume of natural chemicals stored in the stomach which, if ingested regularly over a period of time, may become psychotropic, or even lethal.  My only real chance is to break out of here and raid any stashes of supplies I can find.  However, the evidence against such a move is insurmountable:[br][br]1. I have no source of light[br]2. I swore to myself I wouldn't leave until I heard human voices outside[br]3. The spiders are so tasty[br][new_page][br]Day 100[br][br]From the marks I have been making on the walls, and my scribbled diary entries -which, in the dark, may amount to an illegible scrawl - today is the hundredth day of my new life.  [br][br]Over the past month, my edible friends have become more and more aggressive, and have swelled in number and size.  Whether or not this is a result of my plundering their ecosystem, I am unsure, however, at this rate of growth they will soon be too large to crawl through the gaps in the walls.  For all I know I could only be seeing the tip of the iceberg.  [br][br]If all fails, and I am never recovered, I hope at least that my study of, and, indeed, involvement with, these fascinating creatures, will one day be regarded as an important point in natural history.  The greatest names in modern science got there more through fluke than talent, and it appears that this rule has extended itself to my discovery of this delicious new species.  [br][br]I only pray that the second rule deems my breakthrough too insignificant: for all great discoveries tend to consume their inventor.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="Flashback03">From out the door rises something vast, something terrible. It strikes a man, knocking him down, and those standing by him wither, into the darkness. Screaming begings, still father looks on. Is he bringing this? Father, what have you done?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Flashback04">A cohort, a man with no name. It is he who opens this gateway to hell. A grin on his face, he is terrible indeed, he watches the men writhe, and turn. Still, father looks on, something vital in his hand.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="Red 1.02">Well, I hope that your ears are working better than your tongue, so that you might [br]use them to listen to my words.  You have turned on the light at the end, beginning [br]and middle of the tunnel, but some things remain shrouded in darkness.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 1.03">My morsey message I hope has helped, but what you need now is through the [br]wall hole, to the right of the fence.  Go now!  There's no time to explain!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 1.04">Well, in fact, time is one of the few things we have in abundance down here, but [br]surprises are spoilt by such catty curiosity.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 2.01">Ah, my memory is like something with a great many small holes.  We shall be needing to perform some minor demolition work, so that we might one day meet again.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 2.02">For this task, we shall require the use of a large, earth-eating, metal monster, and that monster is thirsty for juice from the place where things are kept.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 2.03">By the way, you can call me Red.  It is not my name, you understand, but, as I am sure you will agree, it is a name rather similar to a cardigan: fetching, when worn correctly.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 3.01">Ah, those holes in my mind are increasingly gaping!  You cannot breach the inner sanctum of the place of storing, the entry way is blocked.  So the squishy material between my ears is squashier than most! </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 3.02">I may not be perfect like a hanging picture, but my words are wise, and backed up by time!  A pox! Try as I may, you must think that I deceive you with my - admittedly - cunning ways!  </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 3.03">As far as my eye has seen, our rocky grave extends, and yet you cast away my help like you would a puppy, freshly rolled in its own faeces!  I hope that your warped sense of morality is better company than I, because now, it is all that you have left!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 4.01">Um... I'm sorry... Sometimes my emotions are like a disobedient pet: uncontrollable, and often rolling in shit. </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 4.02">Better safe than sorry, they say, but I think we are both sorrier than we are safe.  A tunnel lies between a nearby watery cave, and the place where things are kept.  Take the second right from the closed door, and you will find what you seek.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 5.01">Now, you should find yourself in the watery cave of conversations past, with a tunnel above you from times ahead. In this tunnel, for both our sakes, be careful, not curious.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 5.02">I have already spoken to you about the cat, and repeating myself is not only out of the question, but out of the window and climbing down the guttering. There are spiders in the tunnels that love to suck on humany fluids, so do not disturb the walls, they are fragile like the china vase in the hooves of the bull.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 6.01">There should be some insect repellent in the red and white crossed box in that room.  Just in case those spiders found your flesh delicious.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 6.02">How does my brain flesh know your fluids are leaking?  Because Red tricked you!!! The spidery tunnel was far from a necessary evil, more so, it served as a well deserved punishment!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 6.03">You thought my mind had been lost to the ravages of time, and poetic justice has struck with a sonnet and an eight legged baptism of fire! With justice now served cold, I hope that we can be good friends.  Now reclaim the key and go-go juice, and find a way to the mining monster!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 7.01">You seek the truth behind all this mystery, you think it will set you free!  But truth is relative, and relatives cannot be trusted to bring good gifts.  What you seek lies in the shafts beyond this collapsing of the sky, and if you look closely, so do I. </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 7.02">A century of days has passed, since I saw this area last.  The diseased ones sought to kill poor Red, but I took them on a wild poultry chase, they ended dead. </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 7.03">They came from out the big metal door, but after all my years, I know these caves more.  Hide and seek turned to seek and hide, and I buried them here, beneath the solid rock sky.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 8.01">With my remaining ear to the ground, I hear your trembling tootsies padding towards their final destination.  Things come to those that wait, whether they want them or not, and soon, I think, your wait will be over.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 8.02">The great metal door in reality is calling you, just as the reaper beckons me forward.  I look forward to finally greeting you, I only hope I need not greet the reaperman first.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 9.01">Alas, my friends lie somewhere near you now.  A friend in need is a friend indeed, but a friend that's dead is a poor conversationalist.  May they rest in pieces.  Ruptured, decomposing pieces.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 10.01">Ah, only the engraving etched in the back of my mind can compare to the sights you must be seeing, now power has returned.  I wish I could be there with you, but... circumstances do not allow for such frivolities. </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 10.02">Maybe soon there is something you could do about that.  But tell me, are the rubber belted conveyances now churning in the rock room?  I think I know where they lead... is it some kind of heaven, or utopia?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 11.01">We are now such good and lasting friends - I have gifted you with my love, perhaps you could gift me with something... after all, the laws of politeness would be shattered if you were to appear at our party without a gift. </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 11.02">Poor Red is so hungry he could eat both the horse, and the young, rippling stable hand.  Sadly, pony flesh is so hard to come by in these parts, and man meat is just so bland.  If your eyes happened upon a scurrying rodent, would you deliver the crunchy feast, by way of a final meal?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 12.01">Um... while you hunt for those delicate melt-in-your mouth mousey morsels, there are places you should not go, for fear of death.  The reaper lives here, just like you and I, and just like you and I, he must ingest the living flesh of those less fortunate than him. </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 12.02">There is a small place that I do not want you to visit, even on your holidays, because it is a dark and evil place that I have been, when the darkness has overwhelmed my small, decaying mind. </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 12.03">Some bad things flowed from my mind, and through my pen, the brilliant blue ink itself seemed to turn to blood in my grasp. By the way, should you turn peckish, rat is at its finest sautéed with a little engine oil.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 13.01">Really, the hunger is becoming rather uncomfortable here, how far away are you?  You cannot be far, I am held captive by a wall of stone in the north east of the mine.  As in any drama, there are many roles to be played: you must act the scientist in mixing potions, act the renegade in plots of destruction! </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 13.02">On your travels for the tools with which you will fashion my rescue, you may discover the place of my last meal... be careful: the shiny, solid floor of water is not solid as it seems: poor Red was almost swallowed whole!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 13.03">The two foolsey men who plummeted into my domain have long since departed, though not, I suspect, to whence they came. I ate ravenously of biped meat that day, but, Red promises, feasting only began when the man became pungent, when the stench of life had gone, and only the sweet aroma of decay remained.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 14.01">Oh, my brain can barely imagine the feats of action man like heroics you must be performing, to save old Red!  I am waiting, so close now, for you to blow down the walls of my earth bound prison cell and release me from this mortal coil!  </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 15.01">Where are you my shiny knight?  Have you really made it this far?  I wait and wait, and yet the pot never boils, I remain trapped in my den of inequity. Perhaps the gods have toyed  with me once more, sentenced me to yet more years in this place of eternal night-light.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 15.02">But now, maybe my ill-advice has ended you... have you rung death[u8217]s doorbell?  Please don't leave poor Red all alone once more, like all the others!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 16.01">Good evening! You... you actually came.  There is much that should leave my throat box now, but words elude me.  You came, you are so pretty!  But I have been bad.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 16.02">The underworld already beckons me, so I suppose one further misdemeanour will change little.  It is false pretension, and not guiding light that has lead you here: I cannot give you the answers you want.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 16.03">You may wish to find what it is that you seek, but that is a fiction: you could not know what it was you sought, through that vast leaden doorway, or else you would seek anything else in the world!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 16.04">No, the key stays with me, in here, for the life that has lead me, horrible as may be, is better still than the life that waits for you, hungry, behind those doors.  As replacements go, you shall be admirably abnormal.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 16.05">But you must wonder why this metal burning chamber is talking to you in the voice you knew only as Red... for it is I, your companion, residing within!  </Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 16.06">You see, I have waited for this day so many years... they won't let me die. They... parts of my head are not my own!  And I cannot take my life, it is against the rules.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Red 16.07">Please... the pain has gone on for so long... all I wanted was a friend, but now the time for chit chats and marshmallows by the fire has ended, and I hope that soon, so shall my life.  I have knocked on death's door for so long, please, let him invite me in for tea.</Entry>

  <CATEGORY Name="Intro">
    <Entry Name="01_01">For my part in this allegory, I'm not going to make the same mistake my father made.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="01_02">Howard vanished from my mother's life before I was even in it, so when he sent me a letter, a few days after mum's funeral, it was the first I'd ever heard from him.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="01_03">A pity he was dead. Writing from beyond the grave must be a genetic habit in my bloodline.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="01_04">His letter contained a key, instructions, pleas for forgiveness. I figured the dead don't have much use for absolution, so I turned to his prophetic passing, which he inexplicably expected to come any day.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="02_01">Clearly averse to explanations, my father preferred to leave directions to a bank on Mayfair I'd never even heard of. In that bank was a safety deposit box in his name, and myself as executor.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="02_02">Of course, I went, as he knew I would. </Entry>
    <Entry Name="02_03">I discovered that despite the evidence, he'd been legally declared dead almost thirty years ago, and so the old book, and collection of notes I found had, in the eyes of the law been mine all this time.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="03_00">My father's instructions were to burn the documents, raise no further questions. But that was his error. No man is immune to the shameful trappings of curiosity and... my humanity got the better of me.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="03_01">The university I taught at was world renowned for two things: physics, and linguistics. I represented the first, and the man who stood for the second was stumped by my recent acquisition.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="03_02">The book was indecipherable. The notes, however, showed a location somewhere in uninhabited Northern Greenland.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="04_01">It took me almost a year to book the last flight I would ever take.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="05_01">We landed on a strip of ice a few feet wide, and within minutes I was pulling away on a chartered boat, beginning the 12 hour journey that would lead me into my past.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="04_02">As I watched civilisation disappear, along with Heathrow, I realised my father had disappeared three decades ago, almost to the day, and I considered in turn, what it was that I was leaving behind.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="00_01">My story began in February, year 2000</Entry>
  </CATEGORY>
  <CATEGORY Name="LoadTexts">
    <Entry Name="00_01_to_01_01">As I stepped off the boat, setting out into the blizzard that had formed around me, I realised how utterly devoted I'd been to the discovery of my father's past. I had no idea what to expect.[br][br]Soon enough, my concerns were justified. I don't know whether I lost my orientation, or my spirit, first, but I lost feeling in my extremities soon after, and knew hypothermia was setting in. I started looking for shelter.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="01_02_to_01_03">Whatever I was descending into, it was a hundred feet below ground, protected by two solid, metal hatches, located in a remote, arctic wilderness, and buried beneath the snow. I didn't know what to expect, but it made me feel something I hadn't felt since I was a child. [br][br]I'd never given it much thought before, but I realised that our entire society is a network of safety nets: emergency services at the end of a phone line; health and safety in the workplace; friends; family; lovers. All there, if something goes wrong, part of a carefully designed structure to prevent all but the most mundane of emotions. [br][br]Once again, I felt like I did when I was in school, surrounded by a closing ring of older kids, knowing anyone that might help me - friends, parents, teachers - were too scared, or too far away.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="ClickToContinue">Click to continue.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="01_03_to_01_07">When I look back, I can't think what spurred me to go deeper into the mine. Perhaps it was arrogance at still being alive; or something as ridiculous as facing adversity, and coming out on top. [br][br]Now, I know I would have been better off starving, or being mauled to death, than kick starting the chain of events that lead me to end up here, writing to you. I just hope, once you understand my story, you will have what's necessary to put an end to this tale.[br][br]I certainly didn't.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="01_10_to_01_13">It seems so strange now, to have been guided like a blind man, by a faceless stranger whose sanity was clearly waning, disposition unknown. For all I knew, this 'Red' didn't even have a disposition to speak of, just a seething mass of conflicting emotions.[br][br]I knew that my radio reliant friend must have been cocooned nearby, and perhaps in finding him, I would find myself one step closer to understanding what was going on. In just a couple of hours I would find what I was looking for, and with it would come answers.[br][br]I didn't realise at the time, but the answers I found would be for questions I hadn't even asked.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="01_19_to_01_20">As I stepped into the mouth of the underground facility, there should have been questions, fears, doubts running through me. Instead, I was torn in two.[br][br]Part of me, I felt, had died, along with my only ally, and friend. His final words had raised more questions than they'd answered, and I couldn't get his screams for help out of my head, despite knowing, deep down, that the pain I had caused Red was, itself, all the help I could have offered him. I was alone again, but I had nothing to do, other than press on into the unknown.[br][br]If I'd felt so bad about Red, I should have listened to him and stayed where I was. I would trade his fate a hundred times for my own.[br][br]The other side of me was looking forward, to what might await me in my continued journey. I felt sure that I would soon find some clue or other to my father's fate, and that he was inextricably linked to everything that was happening.[br][br]I also couldn't help but suspect that everything I had seen up until that point was just symptomatic of whatever lay beyond the threshold.[br][br]I know now, I was right.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="DescRubble">This must be the cave in that Red's trapped behind! I need some way to demolish it, quickly. Perhaps I can get some tips from my Explosive's book.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescPassage">This passage has long since fallen away, but Red, or someone, has bridged the gaps with wooden planks.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescPassageDeath">I can barely see the bottom. If I fell, no matter what's waiting down there for me, I'd be dead before I reached it.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="DescFurnance">Why would Red want me to kill him? Why like this? What can I do?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescMeat">Leaving out how Red managed to catch and kill this thing, it's quite clearly inedible. Poor guy must have been close to starving to death.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescRedTable">I can see Red now, sitting here, guiding me. I probably wouldn't be standing here now if it wasn't for him. Why did he have to leave me down here alone?!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescRedShelf">Reams of books... where did Red scavenge all these from? There's everything from survival manuals, to the collected works of Shakespeare, and Kant's Ethics. If this was how he spent his time, no wonder he spoke so strangely. He must have lead a life time of misunderstanding.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescFeases">Jesus! From the stench, I think this may have been his toilet. I... urgh...</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescDoll">My God. That's... horrible. At least I'll be the only person to witness how far Red descended into depravity.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescCage">No wonder he was getting hungry. What a final meal: rationed slugs. Still, knowing Red, perhaps he enjoyed them.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescMadrass">It smells like a sewer, how did Red sleep on this? Maybe he just didn't sleep?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescMachines">Combustion meters, measuring temperature, humidity, and gas flow among others.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="EventPotionDone">Ah, I think that's it! So long as I'm careful when i move it, it should stay stable.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="EventNoGas">There's no gas running to the burner.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="EventLightLitTripod">The gas is already lit.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="EventRedDead">I... Red. I'm so sorry. Whatever happened to you down here, it's over now.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="DescHooks">Vicious looking things, almost like meat hooks...</Entry>

    <Entry Name="DescWallWriting">Poor Red, I'm so sorry. You're at peace now.</Entry>
